    "hello! Is anyone else out here to greet this new member? They're in the need of us so we can chit-chat with them and answer their questions! H-hello, g-guys? Is really nobody gonna h-help? P-please guys, I can't be the only one greeting such innocent and young being on these lands, this can't be it. This can be the end! Our legacy of welcoming members to oblivion can't be over! We can do this, we can reconnect to our roots, be once again what we wanted. If that's what we want, is that what we want? Who knows, perhaps the public wants something else... Perhaps we can't be what we were before, we got to move on, make new memories and new friends. It's such a split memory, it's not possible to determine what's good or not anymore.",
